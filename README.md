# 🧬 Hermes Agent Self-Evolution

**Evolutionary self-improvement for [Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent).**

Hermes Agent Self-Evolution uses DSPy + GEPA (Genetic-Pareto Prompt Evolution) to automatically evolve and optimize Hermes Agent's skills, tool descriptions, system prompts, and code — producing measurably better versions through reflective evolutionary search.

**No GPU training required.** Everything operates via API calls — mutating text, evaluating results, and selecting the best variants. ~$2-10 per optimization run.

## How It Works

                                   Constraint gates (tests, size limits, benchmarks)
                                        │
                                        ▼
                                   Best variant ──► PR against hermes-agent
```

GEPA reads execution traces to understand *why* things fail (not just that they failed), then proposes targeted improvements. ICLR 2026 Oral, MIT licensed.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
git clone https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent-self-evolution.git
cd hermes-agent-self-evolution
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Point at your hermes-agent repo
export HERMES_AGENT_REPO=~/.hermes/hermes-agent

# Evolve a skill (synthetic eval data)
python -m evolution.skills.evolve_skill \
    --skill github-code-review \
    --iterations 10 \
    --eval-source synthetic

# Or use real session history from Claude Code, Copilot, and Hermes
python -m evolution.skills.evolve_skill \
    --skill github-code-review \
    --iterations 10 \
    --eval-source sessiondb
```

## What It Optimizes

| Phase | Target | Engine | Status |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Phase 1** | Skill files (SKILL.md) | DSPy + GEPA | ✅ Implemented |
| **Phase 2** | Tool descriptions | DSPy + GEPA | 🔲 Planned |
| **Phase 3** | System prompt sections | DSPy + GEPA | 🔲 Planned |
| **Phase 4** | Tool implementation code | Darwinian Evolver | 🔲 Planned |
| **Phase 5** | Continuous improvement loop | Automated pipeline | 🔲 Planned |

## Engines

| Engine | What It Does | License |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **[DSPy](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy) + [GEPA](https://github.com/gepa-ai/gepa)** | Reflective prompt evolution — reads execution traces, proposes targeted mutations | MIT |
| **[Darwinian Evolver](https://github.com/imbue-ai/darwinian_evolver)** | Code evolution with Git-based organisms | AGPL v3 (external CLI only) |

## Guardrails

Every evolved variant must pass:
1. **Full test suite** — `pytest tests/ -q` must pass 100%
2. **Size limits** — Skills ≤15KB, tool descriptions ≤500 chars
3. **Caching compatibility** — No mid-conversation changes
4. **Semantic preservation** — Must not drift from original purpose
5. **PR review** — All changes go through human review, never direct commit
6. **Outcome-grounded promotion** — LLM/JEV judge scores are weak semantic signals; a promoted variant needs an independent anchor such as tests, benchmark outcomes, environment success, or explicit human adjudication. Related attempts from one work item stay in the same holdout group.

## Evaluation signals

The optimizer may use cheap semantic observers to understand *why* a run looks good or bad. JEV is a useful seed observer because it can return typed probability distributions without generating prose; an LLM-as-judge remains useful for richer rubrics.

Neither is automatically ground truth.

```text
execution traces
  + objective counters/outcomes
  + JEV / LLM semantic readings
          |
          v
   grouped held-out evaluation
          |
          v
   independently credited mutation
```

Keep judge/observer provenance and work-item lineage with every example. Prefer task-specific automatic verification whenever it exists. Use semantic judges as weak supervision and reflection signals, then let independent outcomes decide promotion.
